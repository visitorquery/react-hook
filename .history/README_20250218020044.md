# @visitorquery/react

Use this package to prevent fraud and abuse by visitors hiding behind proxies and VPNs. With a simple call to `useVisitorQuery`  your website or app will be making a request to our servers which will respond with a boolean value indicating wether the current user is behind a proxy or VPN.

Our checks are not list based like other services who iterate over a database of known proxy IP addresses. We are using deep packet inspection to detect in real time such traffic which is why the api cal lmust be originating from the client's device/browser.

To install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

To run:

```bash
npm run index.ts
```
